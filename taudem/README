TauDEM for Processing
---------------------
TauDEM (Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Models) is a suite of Digital
Elevation Model (DEM) tools for the extraction and analysis of hydrologic
information from topography as represented by a DEM.

Processing is a geoprocessing environment that can be used to call native and
third party algorithms from QGIS, making your spatial analysis tasks more
productive and easy to accomplish.

This plugin implements TauDEM provider for QGIS Processing framework.
Requires QGIS >= 3.0
